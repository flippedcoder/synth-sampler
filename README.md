This project is a practice thing I made to work with functional/stateless React components.
It uses the Tone.js library for all of the musical stuff.

## Run the project

In the root directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

to download all of the dependencies you need. Once you have the dependencies installed, run

### `npm start`

to run the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to play with it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
